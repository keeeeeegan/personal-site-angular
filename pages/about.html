    <p>I'm a web developer and designer working as a front end web developer at <a href="http://cloudspace.com">Cloudspace</a> in Orlando, Florida.</p>

    <p>I'm passionate about creating websites and interfaces, designs, and illustrations. I generally work with Javascript (including some frameworks like Angular and jQuery), X/HTML, and CSS when working on websites and user interfaces. For graphics and illustrations, I work in Adobe products, including Illustrator and Photoshop, but I usually always start on paper. I have an attention to detail (that can sometimes be a curse) and enjoy working with pixel-precision. While meeting clients' needs, I always strive to learn something new, have fun, and improve my craft of creating robust, intuitive, and eye-catching work.</p>

    <p title="Seriously, there are so many places to eat/drink in Orlando. Coffee, craft beer, and itis-inducing food for days.">I enjoy doodling in my spare time...if I'm not watching a movie or practicing my culinary skills, that is. I also like going out and exploring, taking photos, and trying one of the thousand new bars / coffee shops in Orlando.</p>
